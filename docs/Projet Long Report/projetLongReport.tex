\section *{Acknowledgments}
\hspace{1cm}Apart from our personal efforts, the success of any project 
depends largely on the encouragement and guidelines of many 
other persons either from the clients or our school professors. We would like to 
express the deepest appreciation to all our professors at ENSEEIHT
 who introduced us to Computer Science Engineering and helped 
us to acquire solid technical skills and widen our knowledge by
 attending very interesting courses and working on many exciting 
projects during this three years.\\ \\
\hspace*{1cm}We take this opportunity to express our
gratitude to the people who have been instrumental in the 
successful completion of this project. I would like to gratefully 
acknowledge the enthusiastic supervision of Mr. David  \textsc{Doose} and
Mr. Julien  \textsc{Brunel}, both engineering researchers at ONERA, 
who had been a source of inspiration and were always guiding us 
and giving us useful suggestions which helped us in completing
 the project work. They always did there best to
 respond promptly and enthusiastically to all our requests, 
despite their congested daily schedule. I would also like to thank Mr. Jean francois  \textsc{Coiffin}, our
 industrial partner, who helped us to manage the project, 
raise awareness with problems and methods
for this activity and also ensure quality control. \\ \\
\hspace*{1cm}Finally, the reception of ENSEEIHT, which provided us every day
with a room to work in all day long.

\newpage
\section *{Introduction}

\hspace*{1cm}This report deals with the work we did from the end of 
January, in the context of the "projet long". It is proposed by Mr. David
Doose and Mr. Julien Brunel from ONERA, the French Aerospace Lab, 
and deals with pattern recognition in C++ code. We will describe the project management methods 
that we used and then we will present the technical aspects of our project.\\
\hspace*{1cm} Our team consists
 of five ENSEEIHT students (Zohour \textsc{Abouakil}, Fabien \textsc{Sauce})
from the computer science course and (Sofia \textsc{Boutahar}, David \textsc{Courtinot},
Xiaowen \textsc{Ji}) from the imagery and multimedia course, two clients (Mr. David \textsc{Doose} and Mr. Julien \textsc{Brunel})
and an industrial partner from Astrium (Mr. Jean Francois \textsc{Coiffin}) \\
\hspace*{1cm}As third year engineering students in Computer science and applied mathematics, we are interested in groundbreaking technologies. Part of our degree, our final year project has been the right place
 to get in touch with a lot of new technologies and get in touch with 
very skilled and professional persons by working on an
  innovant and ambitious project.\\
\hspace*{1cm} It was the opportunity to discover and set up
 project management systems that are necessary to respect
all the deadlines.

\section{Overview}

\paragraph{}
\hspace{4mm}\textnormal{To get our ENSEEIHT engineering diploma, we are required to 
take part in a project called "Projet long" in teams of five students 
to work on a common project.The project started on January 19, 
and will last eight weeks. It ends up with a defense in which we
 promote our work in front of a jury which evaluates us against 
different aspects :
}

\begin{itemize}
\item Project management and organization\vspace{1mm}
\item Technical accomplishment\vspace{1mm}
\item Report and defense presentation\vspace{1mm}
\item English evaluation\vspace{1mm}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
\hspace{4mm}\textnormal{All over the project, we have to work side by side with the client 
for whom we have to deliver, at the end of the project, a product
 that suits their expectations. Furthermore, we are also supervised 
by Mr. Jean-Francois COIFFIN. He is in charge of helping us 
through his experience in the project management and organization.}

\paragraph{}
\hspace{4mm}\textnormal{We chose to work on that project because of the originality of 
the subject, since it is mixing theoretic computer science and 
technical advanced principles. Moreover, studying model checking 
and temporal logic to assert properties on a source code was a topic that we studied in ENSEEIHT courses. This project is an opportunity to apply this theory and dive deeper into it.}

\section{Subject}

\subsection{Main idea}

\paragraph{}
\hspace{4mm}\textnormal{The client is waiting for a prototype that allows a search of patterns on a C++ code. The patterns will be expressed in terms of temporal logic properties.}

\subsection{Project description}

\paragraph{}
\hspace{4mm}\textnormal{Embedded systems and robotics are designed to interact 
with humans. Therefore, a single failure or a malfunction can 
really be catastrophic. This is why various analyses are undertaken
 to limit and prevent such problems. Theses analysis aim to study 
the embedded code and prove that it does what it is supposed to 
do. The goal of our project is to find out whether the embedded 
code meets a number of programming rules by defining authorized
 and prohibited patterns. Our clients have an existing tool named 
Coccinelle that is developed at INRIA. This tool detects patterns 
and also offers the possibility to modify the code. However, this 
tool only works on C code. The objective of the project is to design 
a prototype for pattern matching in a C++ code.}

\section{Objectives}

\paragraph{}
\hspace{4mm}\textnormal{From a pedagogical point of view, this project was the 
opportunity to apply a lot of techniques that we saw in our three 
years of courses in ENSEEIHT and new techniques that we learned
while working on it. We took our project management courses as a reference to 
organize our time and to catch up with the deadlines. 
}

\paragraph{}
\hspace{4mm}\textnormal{To deliver a good product at the end, we realized that the good coordination
in the team, the regular exchange of ideas during meetings and code/design reviews
and production of relevant documents are main keys of success.}
